Nothing describes Rwanda's culture better than the affectionate hospitality
of its people, the thrill of its Intore culture dancers and singers as well as the
usual determined ethic for work and industry.
Little wonder some have referred to Rwanda as a land of a million smiles.
The country has a population of 9.1million people. Over 85% of the Rwandans
live in rural areas. Rwanda is one of the few countries in Africa,
with a sole common language and culture. Many people who have had a chance
to visit Rwanda have been amused if not intrigued by the actuality that Rwandans
are harmoniously living together after the Genocide that threatened to ruin the
social fabric and destroy the centuries of long interactions among them.
Today, not only are Rwandans living together but they also share the common
aspirations as it used to be. 
Music and dance plays a central role in the tradition of Rwandans.
The Rwandan people have a diversity of music and dance with an assortment
of acts that express epics celebrating excellence and bravery, humorous lyrics
and hunting roots. Intore Dance Troup is the finest model of Rwanda's varied
and dynamic traditional musical and dance style. A wide range of traditional
handicrafts is produced in rural Rwanda, ranging from ceramics and baskets
to traditional and contemporary woodcarvings.&
