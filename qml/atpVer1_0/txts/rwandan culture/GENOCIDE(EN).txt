Genocide is never spontaneous. It is an intentional act of multiple murders, 
aimed at destroying the presence of the victim group. 
Its perpetrators do not respect age, gender, occupation, religion or status. 
Not every act of genocidal violence results in genocide itself. 
Different types of crisis have different names, such as politicide 
(murder of political groups) and ethnocide (murder of ethnic groups). 
This does not imply that one is 'better' or 'worse' than the other, 
but that they are different in either motivation or outcome. 
Whatever the term used, victims of mass murder feel, often with good reason,
that they have suffered a genocidal attempt on their lives. 
The exhibition at the Kigali Memorial Centre introduces several genocides 
and genocidal-type situations. It does not give examples of all genocidal 
massacres because of limited space. It can only illustrate a few examples, 
representing a tragic cross-section of a century of genocide.&
