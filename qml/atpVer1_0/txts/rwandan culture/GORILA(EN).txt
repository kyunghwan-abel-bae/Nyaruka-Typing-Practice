A gorilla visit can entail anything from a 1 to 4-hour trek through the forest,
led by experienced trackers who have spent their entire lives living in or close
to the forest. Your trek will be enchanting as you weave through overhanging
vines, moss-covered Hagenia trees and giant Lobelias that thrive in the tropical
climate. You may spot golden monkeys or see buffalo, bush duiker and a wide
variety of bird life.
But the high point, of course, one of the greatest wildlife experiences on earth,
will be spending an hour with the gentle giant gorillas as they go about their
daily life, feeding, playing, resting, raising their young. At the end of your visit
you will understand what kept conservationist Dian Fossey living in this same
forest for 18 years protecting these wonderful animals.&
