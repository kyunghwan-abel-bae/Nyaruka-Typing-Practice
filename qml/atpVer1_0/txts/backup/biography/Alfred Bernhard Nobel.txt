Alfred Bernhard Nobel was a Swedish chemist, engineer, innovator, 
and armaments manufacturer. 
He was the inventor of dynamite. 
Nobel also owned Bofors, which he had redirected 
from its previous role as primarily an iron
and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon 
and other armaments. Nobel held 350 different patents, 
dynamite being the most famous. He used his fortune 
to posthumously institute the Nobel Prizes. 
The synthetic element nobelium was named after him. 
His name also survives in modern-day companies 
such as Dynamit Nobel and Akzo Nobel, 
which are descendants of the companies Nobel himself established.&
