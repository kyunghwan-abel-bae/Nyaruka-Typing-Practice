Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor and businessman. 
He developed many devices that greatly influenced life 
around the world, including the phonograph, 
the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, 
practical electric light bulb. Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park", 
he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of 
mass production and large-scale teamwork 
to the process of invention, 
and because of that, he is often credited with the creation 
of the first industrial research laboratory. 
Edison is the fourth most prolific inventor in history, 
holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents 
in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. 
He is credited with numerous inventions 
that contributed to mass communication 
and, in particular, telecommunications. 
These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, 
a battery for an electric car, electrical power, 
recorded music and motion pictures.
His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth 
of his early career as a telegraph operator. 
Edison developed a system of electric-power generation 
and distribution to homes, businesses, and factories 
- a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. 
His first power station was on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York.&
