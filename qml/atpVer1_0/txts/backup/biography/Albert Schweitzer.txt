Albert Schweitzer was a German?and later French?theologian, 
musician, philosopher, physician, and medical missionary 
in Africa best known for his interpretive life of Jesus. 
He was born in the province of Alsace-Lorraine, 
at that time part of the German Empire. Schweitzer, 
a Lutheran, challenged both the secular view 
of Jesus as depicted by historical-critical methodology current 
at his time in certain academic circles, 
as well as the traditional Christian view. 
He depicted Jesus as one who literally believed the end 
of the world was coming in his own lifetime 
and believed himself to be a world savior. 
He received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize 
for his philosophy of "Reverence for Life", 
expressed in many ways, but most famously 
in founding and sustaining the Albert Schweitzer Hospital 
in Lambarene, now in Gabon, west central Africa 
(then French Equatorial Africa). 
As a music scholar and organist, 
he studied the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach 
and influenced the Organ reform movement (Orgelbewegung).&
