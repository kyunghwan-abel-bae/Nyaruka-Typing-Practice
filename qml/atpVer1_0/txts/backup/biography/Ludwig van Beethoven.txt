Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer and pianist. 
A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical 
and Romantic eras in Western art music, 
he remains one of the most famous and influential 
of all composers. His best known compositions 
include 9 symphonies, 5 concertos for piano, 
32 piano sonatas, and 16 string quartets. 
He also composed other chamber music, 
choral works (including the celebrated Missa Solemnis), and songs.
Born in Bonn, then the capital of the Electorate 
of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire, 
Beethoven displayed his musical talents 
at an early age and was taught 
by his father Johann van Beethoven and Christian Gottlob Neefe. 
During his first 22 years in Bonn, 
Beethoven intended to study with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
and befriended Joseph Haydn. Beethoven moved to Vienna 
in 1792 and began studying with Haydn, 
quickly gaining a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. 
He lived in Vienna until his death. 
In about 1800 his hearing began to deteriorate, 
and by the last decade of his life 
he was almost totally deaf. He gave up conducting 
and performing in public but continued to compose; 
many of his most admired works come from this period.&
