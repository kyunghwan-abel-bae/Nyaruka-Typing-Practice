The Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, M.C.. 
commonly known as Mother Teresa, 
was an Albanian born, Indian Roman Catholic Religious Sister.
Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, 
a Roman Catholic religious congregation, 
which in 2012 consisted of over 4,500 sisters 
and is active in 133 countries. They run hospices 
and homes for people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy 
and tuberculosis; soup kitchens; children's 
and family counseling programmes; orphanages; 
and schools. Members of the order must adhere 
to the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience, 
and the fourth vow, to give "Wholehearted 
and Free service to the poorest of the poor".
Mother Teresa was the recipient of numerous honours 
including the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. In late 2003, 
she was beatified, the third step toward possible sainthood, 
giving her the title "Blessed Teresa of Calcutta". 
A second miracle credited to her intercession 
is required before she can be recognised 
as a saint by the Catholic Church. Admired 
and respected by many, she has also been accused 
of failing to provide medical care or painkillers, 
misusing charitable money, 
and maintaining positive relationships with dictators.&
