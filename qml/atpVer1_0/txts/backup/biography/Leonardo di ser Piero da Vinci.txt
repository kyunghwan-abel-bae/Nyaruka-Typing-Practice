Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci was an Italian 
Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, 
musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, 
geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. 
His genius, perhaps more than that 
of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. 
Leonardo has often been described as the archetype 
of the Renaissance Man, a man of 
"unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly inventive imagination". 
He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters 
of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person 
ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, 
the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent 
and "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, 
the man himself mysterious and remote". 
Marco Rosci states that while there is much speculation 
about Leonardo, his vision of the world 
is essentially logical rather than mysterious, 
and that the empirical methods 
he employed were unusual for his time.
Born out of wedlock to a notary, 
Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman, Caterina, 
in Vinci in the region of Florence, 
Leonardo was educated 
in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter, 
Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent 
in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan. 
He later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice, 
and he spent his last years in France 
at the home awarded him by Francis I.
Leonardo was, and is, renowned primarily 
as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa 
is the most famous and most parodied portrait 
and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting 
of all time, with their fame approached only 
by Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. 
Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded 
as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items 
as varied as the euro coin, textbooks, 
and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings survive, 
the small number because of his constant, 
and frequently disastrous, experimentation 
with new techniques, and his chronic procrastination. 
Nevertheless, these few works, together 
with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, 
and his thoughts on the nature of painting, 
compose a contribution to later generations 
of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.
Leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity. 
He conceptualised a helicopter, a tank, concentrated solar power, 
a calculator, and the double hull, 
also outlining a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics. 
Relatively few of his designs were constructed 
or were even feasible during his lifetime, 
but some of his smaller inventions, 
such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine 
for testing the tensile strength of wire, entered the world 
of manufacturing unheralded.
He made important discoveries in anatomy, 
civil engineering, optics, and hydrodynamics, 
but he did not publish his findings 
and they had no direct influence on later science.&
