Stephen William Hawking is an English theoretical physicist, 
cosmologist, author and Director of Research 
at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology 
within the University of Cambridge. 
Among his significant scientific works 
have been a collaboration 
with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularities theorems 
in the framework of general relativity, 
and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, 
often called Hawking radiation. 
Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained 
by a union of the general theory of relativity 
and quantum mechanics. 
He is a vocal supporter of the many-worlds interpretation 
of quantum mechanics.
He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts,
a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, 
and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
the highest civilian award in the United States. 
Hawking was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics 
at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.#
Hawking has achieved success with works of popular science
 in which he discusses his own theories 
and cosmology in general; his A Brief History 
of Time stayed on the British Sunday Times best-sellers list 
for a record-breaking 237 weeks. 
Hawking has a motor neuron disease 
related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
a condition that has progressed over the years. 
He is almost entirely paralysed 
and communicates through a speech generating device. 
He married twice and has three children.&
