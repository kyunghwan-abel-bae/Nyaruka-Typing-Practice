Gabrielle 'Coco' Bonheur Chanel was a French fashion designer and founder 
 of the Chanel brand. She was the only fashion designer to appear on Time
 magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. 
Along with Paul Poiret, Chanel was credited with liberating women from the
 constraints of the "corseted silhouette" and popularizing the acceptance of 
a sportive, casual chic as the feminine standard in the post-World War I era.
 A prolific fashion creator, Chanel's influence extended beyond couture
 clothing.  Her design aesthetic was realized in jewelry, handbags, 
and fragrance. Her signature scent, Chanel No. 5, has become an iconic
 product. Chanel was known for her lifelong determination, ambition and
 energy which she applied to her professional and social life. She achieved
 both success as a businesswoman and social prominence thanks to the
 connections she made through her work. These included many artists and
 crafts people to whom she became a patron. However, Chanel's highly
 competitive, opportunistic personality led her to make questionable life
 choices which have generated controversy around her reputation,
 particularly her behaviour during the German occupation of France in World
 War II.&
