Michael Jeffrey Jordan, also known by his initials, MJ, is an American former
 professional basketball player, entrepreneur, and majority owner and
 chairman of the Charlotte Bobcats. His biography on the National Basketball
 Association(NBA) website states, "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the
 greatest basketball player of all time." Jordan was one of the most effectively
 marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in
 popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s. After 
a three-season career at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
where he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in
 Jordan joined the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1984. He quickly emerged as
 a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping
 ability, illustrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in
 slam dunk contests, earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and 
"His Airness". He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive 
players in basketball. In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the
 Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing 
a "three-peat". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball at the
 beginning of the 1993~94 NBA season to pursue a career in baseball, 
he rejoined the Bulls in 1995 and led them to three additional championships
 in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as an NBA-record 72 regular-season wins 
in the 1995~96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in 1999, but
 returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the
 Washington Wizards. Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments 
include five MVP awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine
 All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game appearances, 
three All-Star Game MVP awards, ten scoring titles, three steals titles, six
 NBA Finals MVP awards, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year
 Award. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring
 average(30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average 
(33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American
 athlete of the 20th century by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the
 Associated Press's list of athletes of the century. He was inducted into the
 Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009. Jordan is also known for his product
 endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which
 were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today. Jordan also starred in
 the 1996 feature film Space Jam as himself. He is the majority owner and
 head of basketball operations for the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats, having won a
 bidding war to buy controlling interest in the team from founding owner
 Robert L. Johnson.&
