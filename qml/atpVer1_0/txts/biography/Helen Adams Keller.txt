Helen Adams Keller was an American author, political activist, and lecturer.
 She was the first deaf blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. 
The story of how Keller's teacher, Anne Sullivan, broke through the isolation
 imposed by a near complete lack of language, allowing the girl to blossom as
 she learned to communicate, has become widely known through the dramatic
 depictions of the play and film The Miracle Worker. Her birthday on June 27
 is commemorated as Helen Keller Day in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania and
 was authorized at the federal level by presidential proclamation by President
 Jimmy Carter in 1980, her 100th birthday. A prolific author, Keller was
 well-travelled and outspoken in her convictions. A member of the Socialist
 Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World, she campaigned
 for women's suffrage, labor rights, socialism, and other radical left causes.
 She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1971.&
