Stevland Hardaway Morris, known by his stage name Stevie Wonder, is an
 American musician, singer and songwriter. A child prodigy, he developed
 into one of the most creative and loved musical figures of the late 20th
 century. Blind since shortly after birth, Wonder signed with Motown's Tamla
 label at the age of eleven and continues to perform and record for Motown 
as of the early 2010s. Among Wonder's best known works are singles such
 as "Superstition", "Sir Duke", "You Are the Sunshine of My Life" and "I Just
 Called to Say I Love You". Well known albums also include Talking Book, 
Innervisions and Songs in the Key of Life. He has recorded more than thirty
 U.S. top ten hits and received twenty-two Grammy Awards, the most ever
 awarded to a male solo artist. Wonder is also noted for his work as an
 activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin
 Luther King, Jr.'s birthday a holiday in the United States. In 2009, Wonder 
was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace. In 2008, Billboard magazine
 released a list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists to celebrate the US
 singles chart's fiftieth anniversary, with Wonder at number five. By popular
 vote, Stevie was inducted into The SoulMusic Hall of Fame at
